The master sequencer is the primary sequencer of the ESW OCS system.  Serving as the top layer of OCS, it orchestrates the activities of the other Level-2 subsystems via each subsystem Sequencer or, in some cases, directly to subsystem assemblies.  Although the OCS may consist of multiple sequencers (TBD), this component represents the system of OCS Sequencers.
